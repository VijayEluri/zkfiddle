Hi all,
<br />
I am TonyQ (Tony Wang) , one of the ZK Team, it's my pleasure to introduce this website to you.
<br />
<br />
It's my simple idea since October 2010 when I was on a vacation , I was thinking if we could allow user to publish the
samples online,
<br />
and running the samples immediately , that will be wonderful.
<br />
<br />
It will make user easily to try some case and save it ,share to their programmer / friends as possible.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently ZK have a similar service called "ZK sandbox" already ,(http://www.zkoss.org/zksandbox/)
<br />
but regarding to security issue and some restriction ,it's hard to save user's case on the ZK sandbox.
<br />
<br />
And ZK sandbox can't allow user to create Classes for security reason, so the composer will not be working even when you
write it in Zscript.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I try to find a reasonable solution for a long time,finally I got a way and gave it a try recently.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Building this site for a idea prototyping in two weeks ,
<br />
I will try to keep it growing if you like it and if it does really help us to same samples.
<br />
<br />
It's still a experimental website , actually I am not sure if that's a good idea to compile java classes online.
<br />
<br />
But it's a charming idea for me ,sometimes I have to pray for my ideas. ;)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently we separate the files and sandboxes , that means actually you are running samples in many different/remote
sandboxes.
<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is still a open source project so far, you could find all the source code on github.
